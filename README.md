# AOC 2024

Welcome to this new Advent of Code 2024 repository!
I'll try to do most of the puzzles this year, and put any code I've written to
answer the problems here.

However, since my sleeping schedule does not allow me to start working on the
new puzzle as soon as it is released, and mostly because I am lazy and not in
the mood for it, I am not going to compete with other
participants. Neither am I hoping to appear in any kind of leaderboard :-)

In a nutshell: just to have some fun, participating but not competing!

My solutions are not necessarily optimal, although I might try not to hasten
towards the most naive solution.
I may come back to some of the problems in the future to propose a better (i.e.
more efficient or clean) solution.

Everything is free to use, reuse, distribute (for what it's worth...) and I am
also open to comments and suggestions regarding my solutions. I would be more
than happy to discuss
the drawbacks of my implementations and to learn how to do better code!


Cheers
